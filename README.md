# Attendance Recording System 🗓️

## Project Summary 📄
This report was for a Software Process and Modeling course. During the lab time, we were asked to work on a real case study from UPM and develop a proposed software solution. The problem that selected was the traditional way of taking student attendance, and how this could be automated using AI to verify their attendance using face detection and so on. The process covered two phases of the SDLC: requirements and design.

## Project Artifacts 🗂️
